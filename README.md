# ITAcotron 2

Codebase for the paper "[ITAcotron 2: Transfering English Speech Synthesis Architectures and Speech Features to Italian]()".
For all the references, contributions and credits, please refer to the paper.

This code was originally developed as part of the M.Sc. Thesis in Cognitive Science "[Conditional Text to Speech by Means of Transfer Learning]()".
The M.Sc. degree was released by the Center for Mind/Brain Sciences ([CIMeC](https://www.cimec.unitn.it)) of the Universit√† degli Studi di Trento ([UniTn](https://www.unitn.it)).
The Thesis was supervised at Politecnico di Milano ([PoliMI](https://www.polimi.it)) by the staff of the [ARCSlab](https://arcslab.dei.polimi.it).
