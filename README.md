# ITAcotron 2

Codebase for the paper "[ITAcotron 2: Transfering English Speech Synthesis Architectures and Speech Features to Italian](https://aclanthology.org/2021.icnlsp-1.10/)".
For all the references, contributions and credits, please refer to the paper.

This code was originally developed as part of the M.Sc. Thesis in Cognitive Science "[Conditional Text to Speech by Means of Transfer Learning]()".
The M.Sc. degree was released by the Center for Mind/Brain Sciences ([CIMeC](https://www.cimec.unitn.it)) of the Universit√† degli Studi di Trento ([UniTn](https://www.unitn.it)).
The Thesis was supervised at Politecnico di Milano ([PoliMI](https://www.polimi.it)) by the staff of the [ARCSlab](https://arcslab.dei.polimi.it).

## Usage 

To generate Italian clips, you can use the notebook at the following path: `notebooks/ITAcotron-2_synthesis.ipynb`

## Changes from origin

The code in this repository is based on a fork of the [Mozilla TTS repository](https://github.com/mozilla/TTS).
Please refer to the source for the documentation.

With respect to the original implementation, we modified the following files:
- `TTS/tts/datasets/preprocess.py`
- `TTS/tts/datasets/TTSDataset.py`
- `TTS/tts/utils/text/__init__.py`
- `TTS/tts/utils/text/cleaners.py`
- `TTS/tts/utils/text/symbols.py`
- `TTS/bin/train_tacotron.py`

The code was taken from [this commit](https://github.com/mozilla/TTS/tree/2136433).

## Added configurations 

Configuration files added for the training of Italian TTS: 
- `TTS/tts/configs/config_first_finetuning.json`
- `TTS/tts/configs/config_second_finetuning.json`
